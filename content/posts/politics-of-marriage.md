Every few years our courts hand down a ruling that feels bigger than the law itself; one that pokes at our traditions and forces us to confront how much of what we call “ours” actually isn’t. The Constitutional Court’s recent ruling that men are free to take their wives’ surnames is exactly that kind of moment. On the surface, it looks like a quirky, even amusing change; but beneath it lies centuries of history, patriarchy, and colonial baggage.

Think about it. For generations, women in South Africa could only ever carry their father’s name or their husband’s. They were never afforded the dignity of owning and passing on their own surname; a reflection of colonial systems that reduced women to dependents rather than full human beings. Under Roman-Dutch and English law, a woman ceased to exist legally the day she married. Her property, her voice, even her very identity fell under her husband’s. The simple act of taking his surname was not just tradition; it was law.

But here’s the twist that few seem to want to talk about: the practice of women taking their husband’s surname was never an African thing. In many African cultures, women kept their birth names after marriage, and children often carried their mother’s clan name. Our ancestors didn’t measure a woman’s worth by how well she could attach herself to a man. That was imposed on us by European colonisers and Christian missionaries, who arrived with the belief that women were subhuman and needed to be folded into the male line to preserve property and inheritance rights. We’ve since adopted those ways as if they’ve always belonged to us.

So when people clutch their pearls about this ruling, I can’t help but feel the outrage is shallow. What we’re really defending here is familiarity, not heritage. It’s a familiarity born out of laws designed to silence women and bind them to men. The Constitutional Court put it plainly: the old law unfairly discriminated by giving women the option to change their names, while denying men the same. The ruling recognises that equality isn’t a one-way street.

What excites me about this is not whether men will actually start queuing at Home Affairs to take their wives’ surnames. It’s about what the ruling represents; a crack in the colonial script we’ve been following for too long. It gives us space to remember that our history held space for women in ways the colonisers tried to erase. That the women who fought, who led, who built, have been silenced in part because they could never even carry their own names forward.

Maybe, just maybe, this is our chance to unlearn. To revisit the way we think about family, lineage, and identity. To stop treating women as passengers in their own lives.

The politics of marriage have always been about power; who holds it, who loses it, and how it gets passed down. With this ruling, the Court hasn’t just given men a new right; it has given us all an opportunity to question the old order and imagine something freer, fairer, and truer to who we really are.
