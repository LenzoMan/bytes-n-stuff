# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Hugo and the PaperMod theme. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- Technology
- Programming
- Personal experiences
- And much more!

## Markdown Features

Hugo supports rich markdown formatting, including:

1. **Bold text** and *italic text*
2. Code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Blog readers!")
```

3. And even tables:

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Markdown | ✅ |
| Tags | ✅ |
| Categories | ✅ |
