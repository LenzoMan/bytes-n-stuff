Travelling has a way of humbling you; just when you think you’ve seen it all, a new city reminds you that you’re only scratching the surface. Earlier this year I set off for Zanzibar, a trip I had been looking forward to for ages. I imagined warm evenings, coastal breezes, and the gentle rhythm of island life. What I got on the first night was something closer to a crash course in survival travel.

There’s something magical about arriving in a new destination late at night; the quiet streets, the sleepy locals, the thrill of stepping into a whole new world. It’s a traveller’s rite of passage. Our midnight arrival in Zanzibar, though, felt less like a gentle introduction and more like an initiation by fire; or should I say, by brass-studded doors.

The journey began simply enough. We left O.R. Tambo on an evening flight and landed just after midnight at Abeid Amani Karume Airport. Ours was the only plane on the tarmac, yet clearing customs and collecting luggage still felt like navigating Jozi’s Friday rush. Clearly, efficiency wasn’t high on the night shift’s list.

Eventually, bags in hand, we found our driver, Isah. Cheerful and talkative, he whisked us off towards Stone Town with stories of his city. His driving was put to the test soon enough as the wide roads gave way to the infamous alleyways. Narrow, winding, and stubbornly indifferent to cars, they made Joburg’s taxis look tame.

At one point, Isah was forced into a reverse manoeuvre so delicate it could have been a dance. He pulled it off with surgeon-like precision and parked nearby, assuring us the hotel was only a short walk away.

We reached an imposing set of brass-studded doors that looked as if they belonged on a medieval castle. After a few knocks, a scruffy man in a half-buttoned shirt appeared. His gruff manner softened just enough for him to summon a young receptionist. By then it was past 2 a.m., and we were ready to collapse. That’s when the bombshell dropped: “We can’t find your booking.”

Impossible. “Isn’t this Stone Town V…” we started, but stopped short. Nobody had warned us to double-check the name on the sign above the door. Those magnificent doors had distracted us from the modest sign that read Stone Town House. We were meant to be at Stone Town View Hotel.

Cue the panic.

We tried phoning the correct hotel for a pick-up, but Isah had vanished; his smile and promises now as useful as a broken GPS. With no choice, we set off into the night, guided by the same doorman who had welcomed us moments ago. His generosity, of course, came at a price; not quite daylight robbery, but close enough at 3 a.m. when exhaustion outweighs pride.

After winding through Stone Town’s maze of alleys, we finally stumbled across an old fort. A few idle taxis and a lone *Baijaj* (tuk-tuk) waited outside like guardian angels. After some haggling, we secured a ride and set off once again, holding thumbs that this time we’d land in the right place.

When the *Baijaj* stopped beside a surprisingly busy road for that hour, we saw it: Stone Town View Hotel. Relief washed over us as we dragged our bags inside. It was nearly dawn by the time we collapsed into bed, laughing at the absurdity of it all.

It wasn’t the first night we’d pictured, but it certainly gave us a story. Stone Town had made its introduction loud and clear; and with that, our adventure had officially begun.
