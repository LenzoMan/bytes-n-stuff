I had my very first taste of a Toastmasters event recently, and what fun it was.
Walking in, I didn’t know much about how things worked. I told myself I was simply there to observe, listen, and learn. The theme of the evening was “consistency over perfection,” and the members brought it to life in full colour.

From the soft-spoken to the confident, from those with neatly prepared crib notes to those who spoke purely from memory, each person had their own style, their own rhythm, and their own way of connecting. Every delivery carried its unique “perfect imperfection.” And with every round of constructive feedback, there was something for everyone to take away.

But then came the unexpected moment. Did I mention this was my first ever session, and that I was there only to watch? So when I was suddenly called up to deliver an unprepared speech on the theme of the night, my heart skipped a beat. Wait… me? Already? No prep time?

Still, I had made a quiet commitment to myself to lean fully into the experience. So I stood up, fumbled a little, sprinkled in eight noticeable “uhmms,” and did my best to string together a short speech. It wasn’t perfect—far from it—but it was real.

And that’s exactly the point.

As the evening’s theme suggested, perfection was never the goal. The real victory was showing up, stepping up, and allowing myself to learn through doing. My first impromptu Toastmasters speech was a learning curve—but also a reminder that growth happens when you say yes before you feel ready.
